| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Length** | meters → feet    | 1 meter = 3.281 feet    |
| **Volume** | liters → gallons | 1 liter = 0.264 gallons |
| **Mass**   | kilos → pounds   | 1 kilo = 2.204 pounds   |

Each conversion is displayed clearly, making it easy to understand and use.
